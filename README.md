The project is a fitness and sports app that helps users to achieve their fitness goals. To start using the app, users need to sign up with their email ID. Once signed up, the app asks for basic information about the user's height, weight, and fitness goal. This information is used to create a personalized fitness plan for the user.

The app has a workout section where users can choose from a variety of exercises based on their fitness level and preferences. The exercises are designed to target different muscle groups and can be customized to meet the user's specific needs.

The app also features a diet tracker that helps users keep track of their daily calorie intake and macronutrient consumption. Users can set goals for their daily calorie intake and monitor their progress towards those goals.

The app includes a BMI calculator that helps users determine their body mass index and provides guidance on healthy weight management. Additionally, the app features a period tracker that helps women track their menstrual cycles and provides useful insights into their reproductive health.

Finally, the app includes a water tracker that helps users stay hydrated by monitoring their daily water intake. The app provides reminders to drink water throughout the day and tracks progress towards the user's hydration goals.

Overall, the fitness and sports app is a comprehensive tool for anyone looking to improve their fitness and health. By providing personalized workout plans, tracking diet and water intake, and monitoring reproductive health, the app empowers users to take control of their fitness journey and achieve their goals.

## Tech Stack Used
This document provides an overview of the tech stack used to build a Flutter app with Firebase as the backend.
Flutter
Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter allows developers to write once and deploy across multiple platforms.

We used Flutter to build the user interface of our app, including the screens, widgets, and animations. Flutter provides a rich set of pre-built widgets that can be customized to match the look and feel of your app.


Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Google. Firebase provides developers with a range of tools and services to build and manage mobile and web applications, including authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and hosting.

We used Firebase as the backend for our app, to store user data, authenticate users, and handle real-time communication between the app and the server. Firebase provides a range of easy-to-use APIs that can be integrated into your Flutter app with just a few lines of code.

Flutter SDK: The Flutter SDK is a collection of tools and libraries that enable developers to build native apps for iOS, Android, and the web. It includes a set of customizable widgets, a reactive framework, and a collection of development tools for building and testing apps.

Firebase SDKs: Firebase provides a range of software development kits (SDKs) for various platforms, including Android, iOS, and web. These SDKs provide developers with the tools and resources necessary to integrate Firebase services into their apps.

Cloud Firestore: Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database that allows us to store and sync data in real-time. It enables developers to build scalable apps with minimal setup and maintenance. Firestore can be used to store and retrieve data in real-time, as well as to perform queries and listen for changes.

Firebase Authentication: We used Firebase Authentication as it provides secure user authentication and authorization services. It supports various authentication methods, including email/password, phone number, and third-party providers such as Google and Facebook.

Firebase Cloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage is a powerful object storage solution that enabled us to store and retrieve files in the cloud. It supports multiple file types, including images, videos, and audio files.
